NetSurf
=======

This document should help point you at various useful bits of information.


Building NetSurf
----------------

Read the [Quick Start](docs/quick-start.md) document for instructions.
**NB**: For plan9, refer to the README in the [nsport](https://github.com/netsurf-plan9/nsport) repository.


Creating a new port
-------------------

Look at the existing front ends for example implementations.
The framebuffer front end is simplest and most self-contained.
Also, you can [contact the developers](http://www.netsurf-browser.org/contact/)
for help.
